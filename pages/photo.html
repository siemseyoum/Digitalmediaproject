                            <p> The style for this particular photo was inspired by Ryan Mcvay who used a black background with a high shutter speed to capture the moment of isolation. Capturing a point of view shot of a student gives the perspective of looking out the box. This works well with my report since the research question is about discovering why the youth engages with political information on Twitter.

                            <p>This photograph was inspired by Platon Antoniou who uses black and white in photography to explain the message behind the photo. I used the black and white technique to capture the whole environment as it is the best format that suits all the styles of photography. It also blocks out any distraction the photo has to offer. I used the highest ISO I could possibly get with a small number of apertures. I also used the filter option in the canon 80D which allows me to change any additional light that comes with flash.

                            <p>This photography was inspired by Ward Robert who uses a simple and plain looking photograph to explain his story of a calm city. I took inspiration from one of his basketball court photos containing graffiti and a worn-out net to represent the street ball. The idea for this image shared similarities with the photograph and decided to take the vision and replace the graffiti with the most used emoji.     </p>

                            <p>This photography was inspired by Christian Petersen who specialized in close-up photography. The use of a high shutter speed with 2.5 ISO was required. The point of view is meant to contrast the previous over the shoulder photograph. This shows the spectator what is like to be a consumer engaging with political information. </p>
